# Collatz Encryption - Public Release

This repository contains the **first public version** of the Collatz Encryption system, an encryption method inspired by the **Collatz Conjecture**, an unsolved mathematical problem. This release serves as a **foundation for further development** in encryption research.

‚ö†Ô∏è **A significantly more secure private version is available for purchase, offering encryption that is thousands of times stronger.** If you are interested, contact me via Discord: **Cyberseall**.

## üî• Features (Public Version)
- Encrypts Python files using a novel Collatz-based encryption algorithm
- Generates a unique decryption key for each encryption
- Decryption works without needing external libraries beyond Python‚Äôs standard toolkit
- **GUI-based encryption and decryption tool** built with Tkinter
- Support for compiling encrypted files into standalone executables
- Uses a mathematical transformation based on the Collatz Conjecture for obfuscation
- Hard to detect by antivirus software due to its unique structure
- Potential resistance to quantum computing attacks due to its non-linear transformation

## üîí Features (Private Version - Available for Purchase)
- **Advanced Key Evolution:** The private version utilizes a dynamically evolving key structure that exponentially increases complexity, making brute-force attacks infeasible.
- **Post-Quantum Security:** Enhances resistance to quantum algorithms by integrating **lattice-based** cryptographic techniques alongside Collatz transformations.
- **Multi-Layer Encryption:** Supports **AES-256** and **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** in combination with Collatz-based obfuscation.
- **Anti-Tampering & Obfuscation:** Introduces an 8-byte fake header and runtime memory obfuscation to prevent reverse engineering.
- **Secure Execution Environment:** Implements anti-debugging, anti-VM detection, and hidden process execution to evade forensic analysis.
- **Integrity Protection:** Uses **HMAC-SHA256** to ensure encrypted data has not been tampered with.
- **Custom Key Splitting:** Supports key fragmentation across multiple distributed storage locations for added security.
- **Faster Decryption Performance:** Optimized key iteration algorithms allow decryption speeds **up to 10x faster** than the public version.

**Why is the Private Version 1000x More Secure?**
- Uses multi-layer encryption instead of a single-layer XOR transformation.
- Prevents all known forms of attack against static key evolution by introducing randomness.
- Defends against **Shor‚Äôs Algorithm**, making it quantum-resistant.
- Implements memory scrambling techniques to prevent key extraction from RAM.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
This encryption system relies on bitwise operations and iterative transformations derived from the **Collatz Conjecture**:

1. Each character in the original Python script is converted to its ASCII value.
2. A bitwise XOR operation is applied using a dynamic key.
3. The key evolves dynamically based on the following rules:
   - If the key is **odd**, apply `key = (key * 3) + 1`
   - If the key is **even**, apply `key = key / 2`
4. The process continues iteratively, ensuring a non-linear encryption pattern.
5. To decrypt, the process is reversed, using the same initial key.

**Example of encryption logic:**
```python
for char in data:
    encrypted_char = ord(char) ^ key
    encrypted_data.append(encrypted_char)
    key = (key * 3 + 1) if key % 2 else (key // 2)
```

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)

### Install Required Libraries
No additional libraries are needed beyond the Python standard library.

### Usage Instructions
1. **Run the Encryption Tool:**
   ```bash
   python encryptor.py
   ```
   - Select a Python file to encrypt.
   - Provide an encryption key (integer).
   - The encrypted file (`.bin`) and decryption key (`.txt`) will be saved.

2. **Run the Decryption Tool:**
   ```bash
   python encryptor.py
   ```
   - Select the encrypted `.bin` file and the corresponding `.txt` key file.
   - The original Python script is restored.

3. **Compile Encrypted Code into an Executable:**
   ```bash
   python compiler.py
   ```
   - Select the encrypted `.bin` file and the `.txt` key file.
   - The program compiles an executable (`.exe`) that automatically decrypts and runs the script.
